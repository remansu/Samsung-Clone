# Samsung UI Clone (HTML + CSS)

##  Project Description

This is a fully responsive clone of the Samsung official landing page, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It mimics Samsung’s clean, modern design, including:

- Top navigation bar
- Hero section with auto-sliding banner
- Featured product grid
- Footer with social icons

This project was created to practice frontend design, responsive layout, and pixel-perfect UI cloning — and to showcase my skills as an aspiring frontend developer.

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/remansu/Samsung-Clone.git

## 📚 What I Learned

- Improved understanding of Flexbox and Grid layout
- Gained experience replicating pixel-perfect designs
- Learned how to create a CSS-only image carousel
- Practiced deploying live projects using GitHub Pages
